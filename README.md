## Overview:

I got the dataset from "ESPNcricinfo" website where I took datasets of Bowlers and Batsmans who played till now in T20 world cup and did the analysis.

## Tools Used: MYSQL, MS Excel

## Steps in the Analysis:

* I did Web Scraping in the analysis where I used Excel to fetch the data and convert into tabular form in Excel.
* I did the above same steps for both the batsman and bowlers data and did some data cleaning via Excel.
* Now, I used MYSQL to analyze those datasets and answer specific questions regarding the dataset.

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a good dataset to analyze and find insights using SQL queries.
